# Gr12CulminatingTask
This was the culminating task for my grade 12 computer science course.

The gist was to research a specific branch of computer science and technology and choose a subbranch or focus. I chose to look into computer vision, with a focus on facial recognition and the ethical and social consequences it has. For the coding side of the project, I decided to incorporate object oriented programming and a graphic user interface to make an artifact to represent facial recognition.
